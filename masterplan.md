## High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

Based on the provided nuxt.config.ts and package.json files:

### Frontend and Backend:
- Nuxt 3 (version ^3.13.0) for a unified Vue.js-based frontend and backend solution
- Vue.js (latest version) as the core frontend framework
- @nuxt/ui module (version ^2.18.4) for pre-built UI components and styling

### Build and Development:
- Nuxt CLI for building, development, and preview
- TypeScript support (implied by the .ts configuration file)

### Database:
- SQLite database through Nitro's experimental database feature
- better-sqlite3 (version ^11.2.1) as the SQLite driver

### Server:
- Nitro server (built into Nuxt 3) with experimental database support enabled

### Authentication:
- Custom JWT-based authentication system
- Utilize `jose` library for JWT handling
- Integrate with the SQLite database for user storage
- Implement password hashing using `bcrypt`

Rationale: A custom JWT-based solution aligns well with the current SQLite setup and provides flexibility for implementing specific authentication requirements. This approach avoids introducing complex external dependencies while maintaining control over the authentication process.

### File Storage:
- To be determined based on specific requirements (local storage or cloud solutions can be integrated)

### Real-time Updates:
- To be implemented, potentially using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events

### AI Integration:
- To be determined based on specific requirements for smart tagging functionality

### Offline Capabilities:
- To be implemented using Nuxt's built-in PWA support or custom service workers
