# Updated SaaS Note-Taking App Masterplan

## Technical Stack Refinements

### Authentication:
- Implement Auth0 as the third-party authentication provider
- Integrate Auth0 with Nuxt 3 for secure user management

### File Storage:
- Implement a local file system structure emulating cloud storage patterns:
  ```
  /storage
    /users
      /user_id_1
        /notes
        /attachments
      /user_id_2
        /notes
        /attachments
  ```
- Design with future cloud migration in mind
