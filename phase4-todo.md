   * Updated app-structure.md to reflect new testing setup

## Completed Enhancements

* Improved type safety in components and stores
* Enhanced responsive design for filtering and sorting controls
* Implemented consistent error handling and loading state management

## Next Steps
* Conduct thorough testing of all implemented features
* Review and refine tests as needed
* Implement continuous integration to run tests automatically
* Consider adding more comprehensive test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios
* Explore performance optimizations for the dashboard, especially with large datasets
* Investigate and implement accessibility improvements
* Consider adding more advanced features like note sharing or collaboration tools

## Mobile Optimization (Future Phase)
* Ensure responsive design works well on various mobile devices
* Optimize touch interactions for mobile users
* Consider developing a dedicated mobile app if needed

## Documentation
* Update user documentation to reflect new features and enhancements
* Create developer documentation for the testing infrastructure and best practices

## Security Review
* Conduct a security audit of the implemented features
* Ensure all API endpoints are properly secured
* Review and enhance authentication and authorization mechanisms if needed
