# Phase 4 Todo List

## Notes Functionality Enhancements

* [DONE]Enhance the Notes Store:
   * The basic structure of the notes store (stores/notes.ts) is already in place, but we can improve its integration with the new API endpoints and error handling.

* [DONE]Update the Dashboard Component:
   * The dashboard component (Dashboard.vue) already exists, but we can enhance it to use the secured API endpoints and improve its functionality.

* [DONE]Implement Note Detail/Edit Page:
   * While we have a basic structure for the notes list in the dashboard, we need to create a dedicated page for viewing and editing individual notes.

* [DONE]Refine Error Handling and Loading States:
   * Implement consistent error handling across components
   * Add loading indicators for API operations

* [DONE]Implement Note Filtering and Sorting:
   * Enhance the existing dashboard to include more advanced filtering and sorting options

* Testing:
   * Add unit tests for the notes store and components
   * Implement integration tests for the notes functionality
